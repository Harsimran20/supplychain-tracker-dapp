# 🏗️ Supply Chain Management System (Solidity)

A decentralized Supply Chain Management DApp built using **Solidity**, focusing on transparency and traceability—**without the use of tokens or ethers**. The system tracks products through different lifecycle stages: from manufacturing to delivery, ensuring secure state transitions through role-based permissions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create and manage products
- 🔐 Role-based access (Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer)
- 📦 Product lifecycle tracking:
  - Manufactured → In Transit → Delivered
- 🧾 Transparent state transitions using events
- 🛠️ No tokens or monetary transactions—pure logic

## 🧠 Smart Contract Overview

### 🗂️ Product Structure
```solidity
struct Product {
  string name;
  address manufacturer;
  address distributor;
  address retailer;
  State state;
}
🔁 States
enum State { Manufactured, InTransit, Delivered }
🧪 How to Use (Remix IDE)
Deploy the Contract using a Remix environment (e.g., JavaScript VM).

Call createProduct("ProductName", "0xDistributorAddress")

Ensure you are using a valid Ethereum address.

Use shipProduct(productId) as the distributor.

Use receiveProduct(productId) as the retailer.

📝 Use different accounts in Remix to simulate roles (manufacturer, distributor, retailer).

🧰 Tech Stack
Solidity v0.8.x

Remix IDE for development/testing

Ethereum-compatible blockchain (no gas usage if using Remix JS VM)
